## Assignment 11 and 12 Questions

Note: this questions file is designed to help you document what you've done in your assignment. It is important as this is the way we will understand what you have done for grading.

An example `QUESTIONS.md` file is in the `Examples` directory (QUESTIONS-example.md).

## Assignment 11

The rubric has a list of 13 items.

Item 2: List at least 3 distinct behaviors. If you have made more than 3, list up to 5 and choose the ones you think are most interesting. A single sentence describing each one should be sufficient.

2.A: Basketball player jumps when she throws basketball.
2.B: UFO "abducts" a cube and drops it off back and forth between two locations.
2.C: Train drives around a figure 8 track.
2.D: Helicopter flies in a cirle, both roters spin using a heirarchical model.
2.E: Basketball flies out of players hands and into the hoop.

Item 3: Do you have a spline train track? What object should we look at? How do we know it's a spline?

Yes, the figure 8 train track in the center of the world is a spline. It goes through 6 points in a closed curve with C1 continuity.

Item 4: Do you have a train that faces forward on the track and is ridable?

Yes, the train is ridable from a passengers perspective (looking out the window). It always faces forward on the track.

Optional Complexity Points: For each one that you've done, give the number (5-13) on the list, describe the behavior, and tell us what object we can see it on. This might take 2-3 sentences per item.

5: the plane object follows a 3D curved path. The x and z values are determined by a rotation around a center point, and the y value is dermined by a cosine function.

7: UFO flies to one destination, does a secondard behavior (abduction of the cube) and then flies to another location.

14: additional complexity points for the cube being "abducted" by the ufo, and moved to other location, and being adbucted again from the new location.


List which other "Behavior Challenges" you completed (from the list of 13 - anything 5 and above). For each, give the number as well as a short (1 sentence is OK) description. And tell us where in the world to see it (what object should we "lookat" and/or "ride"):


## Assignment 12

Object Diversity: List 8 of the different kinds of objects that appear in your world. If you made more than 8 kinds of objects, only list the 8 that are most interesting visually.

O.1
O.2
O.3
O.4
O.5
O.6
O.7
O.8

Object Diversity: list one object in your world that is loaded from a model file (e.g., OBJ or FBX). Remember to give proper attribution in your README file, and to include the object in your repository.

Object Diversity: list one of each category
Building:
Natural Element:
Vehicle (object meant to move):

Technical Challenges: For each technical challenge you attempted (from the list of 7), give the number of the challenge, a description of what you did, and a description of the object that it was used on. What objects should we "look at".

Pictures: confirm that you placed the required pictures in the Pictures directory.

Consent: do you agree to allow us to use your pictures in future gallery pages? (please answer Yes or No)
